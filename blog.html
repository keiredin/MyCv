        <p class="title"> How does relative size(%,em,rem) affect the styling and responsiveness of webpages  </p>
        <article>
        <p>
            There are two types of css units: relative and absolute units. Relative units are related to the viewport or font size of an element whereas absolute units
            are always constant or the same regardless of viewport or font size.
        </p>
        <p>
                One of the absolute units is px which is common for bordering. 
                When we set one value of px for elements, every element will have 
                the same value. For instance, if our screen size is 1200 * 700
                pixels, and if we place an element of width 1300px, it can’t fit with the screen, 
                so it is necessary to scroll horizontally.This is the fundamental limitation of using px. Therefore relative units are
                necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
                Some of relative units are em and rem which are common for margin/padding and font size
                and font size respectively. Em is relative to font size of the element whereas rem is relative to the default 
                font size instead of the current element’s font size, the default font size of the browser is
                usually 16px. It is common to use relative size em and rem over pixel because they would make our design more accessible.
        </p>
        <p>
                In general, it is better to use relative size to styling the size of an element.
                Even if the browser is providing zoom feature, using relative size is better.
                The user should not be bother about how to get the zoom feature of browser, how
                to use and adjust font display setting. Not only that but also the UI that is
                appeared using relative size is better than using zoom feature of the browser.
                If we set a higher default font size, it is not necessary to zoom in browser to
                able to read the website because relative units would increase to what font size we want. 
                Therefore, I conclude that using relative size for size styling is responsive and
                we have to use it.

            <p class="title"> We said 16px is default browser width so what does it mean when we say 200px ? How does the browser interpret that ?</p>
            <article>

                <p>
                    In almost every browser, 16px is the standard for proportional fonts,
                    but there are some browsers like opera mini7 that have another
                    default font size. Users can change the default value to anywhere from
                    9px to 72px.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the default font size is 16px, which is equivalent to 1rem or 1em,
                     so by simple calculation 200px is equal to 12.5rem.
                </p>

                <p>Therefore, when we use 200px, we are trying to make the font size or something of the element 12.5rem or 12.5em.</p>
                <p>So how does the browser interpret this. The browser creates DOM Tree (Document Object Model) and
                    each node of the tree represents html tag. After the browser created DOM Tree,
                     it creates map of the css style found in the web pages, which is
                    called CSS Object Model (CSSOM). Render tree is formed by combining DOM and CSSOM trees,
                     that is ready to be rendered.</p>
                <p>The browser traverses each node of DOM tree starting from the root and select nodes which will be omitted/visible.
                    For each visible node, appropriate CSSOM rules will be matched. After the browser finds which rules apply to which 
                    element, it calculates and then display the result effect on the screen.
                </p>

        <p class="title">  The specific changes in css3 </p>
        <article>

            <p>Below is the major specific changes in CSS3.</p>
            <p><strong>Text Shadow:</strong> Text shadow property allows to add drop shadows to the text on a webpage.
                This is done by image or duplicating text element and then positioning it properly.</p>
            <p><strong>Box Shadow:</strong> It allows to create a drop shadow for an element. Most of the time this effect is done by using repeated
                image around the element, but because of box shadow that is done with a single line of code.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Border Image:</strong> It is the ability to swap out a border with an image. It allows to specify an
                image to display instead of a plain solid colored border.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Rounded Corners:</strong> Before css3 a lot of code was required to create a rounded corner. Give attention on height,
                width and positioning is very boring. CSS3 introduces border radius property which gives the same rounded
            corner effect.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Selectors:</strong> CSS3 introduce some new selectors. By using these selectors it is possible to choose DOM
                elements based on their attributes, so it might not necessary to specify classes and IDs for every
                element. Instead of that utilizing the attribute field to style them.</p>
            <p><strong>Web Fonts:</strong> CSS3 introduces embedding any custom font on a webpage. Web pages
                render only fonts that are supported by the browser or client machine.</p>
            <p><strong>Multicolumn Layout: </strong> Most of webpages are made by columns or boxes and these boxes are adjusted by designers.
                Multicolumn layout simplify this problem and allow to specify only the number of columns and then they
                will be formed.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Transform:</strong> It enables to rotate web elements on a webpage. Before CSS3 JavaScript was required 
                to rotate an element and they consume more resources, so CSS3 simplify this by introduce transform
                attribute.
            </p>
